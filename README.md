# About Our Software

We are planning to develop an automated event finder web application that will dynamically pull event data from sources such as Eventbrite and Google Events. The app will include features such as event filters (by location, date, and type) and links to directions. Additionally, it will suggest popular food spots near each event.
We are also considering integrating an AI feature to suggest food and drink pairings based on the type of event, offering a unique experience for users attending specific events.

It is very common in these sections to see code in peculiar boxes to help them stand out. Check the markdown section of the Project Specifications to see how to add more / customize these.

```python
def code_highlight_example(m: int, m: float, s: str) -> str:
	return s + str(n*m)
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

```c#
